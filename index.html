  <p>My name's Ethan, I'm a developer who specializes in game development and programming languages.
  I love doing both, and currently work for Asymptotic to make formal verification tools for the Sui blockchain.
    <br>
    <br>
    My main technical expertise is in low level languages like Rust, concurrency, functional programming, and language design.
    I've worked on a variety of technical projects in each, and accrued a passion for software design.
    <br>
    <br>
    Currently, on the side, I'm also working on a new programming language called Raven and a toy browser.
    I also maintain a few websites, discord bots, open source projects, and game mods.
    <br>
    <br>
    One thing about me that's probably obvious from my portfolio is that I love big projects. Working on big codebases
    over months and slowly architecting and improving on them is something I enjoy a lot.
    <br>
    <br>
    I'm also apart of the Aggie Competitive Programming Club and a former Project Manager of the Aggie Coding Club.
    I've also done game development on the side, using Unity, Godot, and Bevy.
