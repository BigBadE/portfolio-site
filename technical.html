<h2><a href="https://github.com/asymptotic-code/sui-prover">Sui-Prover</a></h2>
<p>For my work with Asymptotic, I've been working on a Lean backend for their formal verification tool.
The tool itself is pretty simple: When writing financial code, you want to ensure that bugs won't ever let people steal money.
For example, if I was writing a withdrawal function, I'd want to make sure that under no circumstances does the user end up with more money than they started with.
Formal verification is just that, you tell the tool "Make sure that if you run the code new_balance = withdraw(balance, x), new_balance <= balance"

My specific job is writing a <a href="https://lean-lang.org/">Lean</a> backend. Lean is a functional (like Haskall) formal verification language. I'm working on a tool
to convert the bytecode from the Sui code (called Move) to Lean source code, which is certainly a difficult task.</p>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/BigBadE/Raven-Language">Raven Language</a></h2>
<p>Raven is a programming language I've been working on for a few years. The main idea is to combine a low-level language like Rust
with scripting-like syntax and memory management and change/add a few features that I've always wanted.

This would ideally be done with a combination of the
    <a href="https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2024/06/02/the-borrow-checker-within/">"borrow checker within"</a>
    thought up by Niko Matsakis and <a href="https://overreacted.io/algebraic-effects-for-the-rest-of-us/">algebraic effects</a>,
along with a "modular" compiler. The idea is users can have power user advanced features like manual memory management, or can
opt for a more scripting-like approach. This is more theoretical than practical at the moment, but I've learned a lot implementing it!</p>

<h2><a href = "https://github.com/BigBadE/Exokernel">Exokernel</a></h2>
<p>A BIOS exokernel I wrote by hand in Rust using the <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page">OSDev wiki</a>.
    Currently it's stuck in 32-bit protected mode due to a memory bug,
but it's been a massive learning experience with a lot of lower level techniques and implementation details of computers.</p>
